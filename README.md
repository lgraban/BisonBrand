# Bison Brand
Bison Brand is a passion project of mine that I created in 2021. In my free time I like to build mock websites and this is one that I have created.
The majority of the code is HTML, however there is a fair amount of CSS sprinkled in there. The toughest part about this project was implementing JavaScript to make a functioning shopping cart.
You can put items into the cart and take them out if you want. At the end when you go to "checkout" the page will display the total cost of your purchases.
